"""Theme documentation for the stoei TUI.

The actual CSS styles are in the .tcss files in this directory:
- app.tcss: Main application styles
- modals.tcss: Modal screen styles

The styles reference Textual theme variables such as $background, $surface,
$accent, and custom variables like $text-muted. Theme palettes are defined in
stoei.themes and include a terminal ANSI theme plus OpenCode-inspired light
and dark variants.
